# SvelteKit template

This project includes my preferred setup for building a Sveltekit project, this includes the following libraries:

1. Sveltekit - configured with Typescript, a standard create-app built from `sv create app`
2. Prettier - syntax formatting, with my preferred configuration in `.prettierrc`
3. Eslint - linting for obvious syntax errors
4. Shadcn + Tailwind - components and CSS
5. Docker scripts + Postgres - if database is needed scripts available to run Postgres
6. lucide-svelte - icon library
7. mode-watcher - used for dark/light mode switching
8. svelte-sonner - used to create toasts throughout the application
